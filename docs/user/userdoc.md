## What is EpiTrello?

EpiTrello is a simple, visual project management tool that helps you organize your work using boards and cards. Think of it like a digital bulletin board where you can:

- **Create Boards** for different projects
- **Organize Tasks** into columns (like "To Do", "In Progress", "Done")
- **Track Progress** by moving cards between columns
- **Collaborate** with teammates on shared boards
